I feel like I'm moving a bit slower this week but I'm enjoying the course. I'm moving slower because I'm taking some time to create a ted ed question for about half the videos that I watch. I find this to be a lot of fun and it helps me solidify my understanding of the subject, but it's a little time consuming.

I added a new practice to my learning this week, "Maintenanace". I wrote about it in the README.md file
