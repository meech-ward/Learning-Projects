# High School Physics

## Week 1

I spent about 4:15 time on this course in week 1 working through [One Dimensional Motion](https://github.com/meech-ward/Learning-Projects/issues/1) and [Two Dimensional Motion](https://github.com/meech-ward/Learning-Projects/issues/2). I fell short of my target of at least 5 hours, but I feel good about understanding the content.

I didn't track what I was doing with my time so I'm not sure about how much time was actually spent on videos, notes, practice, etc. This is something I will do for the following weeks to get a better idea of when I might actually complete the course.
