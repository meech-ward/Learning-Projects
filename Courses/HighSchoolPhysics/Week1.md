# High School Physics

## Week 1

I spent about 4:15 time on this course in week 1 working through [One Dimensional Motion](https://github.com/meech-ward/Learning-Projects/issues/1) and [Two Dimensional Motion](https://github.com/meech-ward/Learning-Projects/issues/2). I fell short of my target of at least 5 hours, but I feel good about understanding the content.

One dimensional motion is pretty simple and the [kinematic formulas](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/one-dimensional-motion/kinematic-formulas/a/what-are-the-kinematic-formulas) eventually started to make intuative sense. I just think like i'm in a car where speed, distance, time, and acceleration are all thought about. Two dimensional motion is just as simple, you just have to break down your two dimensions into two seperate one dimensional equations.

I didn't track what I was doing with my time so I'm not sure about how much time was actually spent on videos, notes, practice, etc. This is something I will do for the following weeks to get a better idea of when I might actually complete the course.
