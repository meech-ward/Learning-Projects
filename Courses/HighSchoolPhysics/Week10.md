# High School Physics

## Week 10

I spent about 4 hours on Physics this week

* Distributed practice 0:10
* Angular Momentum and Torque notes & practice 4:00

I feel less accomplished this week but I went away for the long weekend to see friends so their wasn't as much time to study. Also I'm finding the subject this week to be less interesting that other subject's i've done. I'm not sure why I'm not as interested in Torque.
