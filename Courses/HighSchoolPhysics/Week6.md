# High School Physics

## Week 6

I only spent about 2 and a half hours on physics this week. I went snowboarding at Whistler from Friday to Monday, so I got less of everything done.

* Distributed practice 0:15
* Work and energy video, notes & practice 1:00
* Work deliberate practice 1:15

I wish I had gotten more done, but at least I still got this much done. I'll try to do more next week.
