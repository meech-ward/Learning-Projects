# High School Physics

## Week 8 & 9

I did only about 3:20 hours of physics work for the past two weeks. This is a very small amount of time compared to my target. This is mainly because it was my Birthday, so I spent more time snowboarding. I also had to take an English test for immigration puposes, so I spent last week studying for that.

* Center of Mass video & notes	1:10:06
* Collisions video & notes	0:48:11	
* Impacts and linear momentum Quiz	0:54:08
* Mastery 26:00

Center of mass was a fun concept. I even ended up making some practice questions for this on ted ed. In fact, i've been creating ted ed questions for some of the videos I've been watching:

* Impulse and momentum [Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/bigbingo_redirect?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.khanacademy.org%2Fscience%2Fphysics%2Flinear-momentum%2Fmomentum-tutorial%2Fv%2Fintroduction-to-momentum&conversion_ids=condensed_tutorial_title_click) [Varsity](https://www.varsitytutors.com/ap_physics_1-help/impulse-and-momentum)
* Elastic and inelastic collisions [Khan](https://www.khanacademy.org/bigbingo_redirect?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.khanacademy.org%2Fscience%2Fphysics%2Flinear-momentum%2Felastic-and-inelastic-collisions%2Fv%2Felastic-and-inelastic-collisions&conversion_ids=condensed_tutorial_title_click)

These will be good for anyone else who wants to learn, but I think I could also use them for distributed practice.

## Review so far

This course was originally planned to take about 8 - 10 weeks, so I should be close to finishing up right now. However, this is not the case. Just going by the number of sections, 18, and the number i've completed, 7; it looks like I'm about 40% through the course. That being said, I feel great about what I have learned and I score 100% on all the tests I take. 

If I keep this pace I should complete the course in another 14 weeks, making the total course length 23 weeks. But if I continue to understand as much as I am, I will understand every topic in this course, which would be great.

My new predictions are:

* Total hours per week: 4 - 6 hours
* Total weeks to complete the course: 23 weeks.


I am still really pleased with the process I am using to learn Physics. I must give credit to Scott h. Young though and his rapid learner course. For the past couple of weeks, I have been thinking of building a platfrom to make setting up a course like this easy. Potentially even be able to share it with other people so anyone could take this course in the way I have set it up for myself. Eventually, people could even end up contributing their own courses, so I wouldn't have to do all the setup.
