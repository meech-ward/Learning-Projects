# High School Physics

## Week 5

I spent about 4 and a half hours on physics this week.

* Distributed practice 1:30
* Work and energy video, notes & practice 3:00

I think I spent more time this week on distributed practice, reviewing older topics from other weeks. I do feel that this is really helping me understand the earlier topics but it is time consuming.

The subjects introduced this week are definitely getting more complicated, but more complicated usually means more interesting. I usually like to derive formulas from scratch, but I find myself just using the formulas for kinetic energy & centripetal acceleration without deriving them. I think this makes sense and saves time, but it's not what I usually do in Math. 

Conservation of energy is definitely my favorite topic right now. It makes sense and it's incredibly useful, especially when using the equation for kinetic energy 1/2*mv^2.
