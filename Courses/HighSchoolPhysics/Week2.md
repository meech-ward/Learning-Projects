# High School Physics

## Week 2

I spent about 4:30 time on this course in week 2 working mostly through [Forces and Newton's laws of motion](https://github.com/meech-ward/Learning-Projects/issues/3). I also did the quiz for the first two subjects from last week. I fell short of my target of at least 5 hours again, so I want to try harder to manage my time better.

Here's a rough breakdown of the hours:

* 3:10 Watching the videos and taking notes. (This includes practicing in the moment to understand the subject)
* 0:40 on the quizes.
* 0:40 Delibirate Practice.

I feel that I understand Newton's laws after this week and I have a better understanding of the first week's material. I feel good about what I'm learning. The only thing I want to improve is the amount of time I dedicate to this.
