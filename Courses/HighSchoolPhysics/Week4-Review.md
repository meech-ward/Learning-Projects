# High School Physics

## Week 4

I did 5:40 hours of physics work this week.

* Centripetal force and gravitation quiz 0:25:01
* Centripetal force and gravitation video & notes	0:40:01	
* Mastery	0:46:41	
* Work and energy practice	0:25:15	
* Work and energy video & notes 	3:23:56

The new topic this week is Work and Energy. Really cool and exiting topics, but a little more difficult for me to understand. It's making sense but it's just taking a little longer than learning centripetal force last week.

## Review so far

I am really happy with my progress so far, mostly everything is working out as expected. 

I am understanding all the topics, using my resources for deliberate practice of the topics, and taking and passing the quizes after each section. I am most happy about my [Distributed Practice](https://github.com/meech-ward/Learning-Projects/tree/master/Courses/HighSchoolPhysics#distributed-practice) which is working really nicely. At this point, I don't feel the need to change anything, which is great and uncommon for me.

I am not using the 'question book method' to quiz myself at the end of each week. I think it's a bit much as everything else is working really well. I might bring this back, or use it in another course if there's not enough practice material.

### Time comitment

My original time predictions were:

* Total hours per week: 5 - 7.5 hours
* Total weeks to complete the course: 6 - 10 weeks.

So far i've spent about 20.5 hours on physics. This averages out to about 5 hours per week. I'm realizing that I can realistically commit only about 2 hours a day at most using the pomedoro technique. I'm still within my 2 - 3 days per week prediction.

As for the 6 - 10 weeks prediction, I think I underestimated how long it would take me to understand the material. I'm spending my time wisely, covering material and practicing, but I'm just spending more time than I thought to get through the different subjects. My assumptions were based on how long the Khan Academy videos are, but I'm pausing the videos a lot to work out problems on my own before continuing with the video.

 At my current velocity, I predict it will take me 16 weeks total to complete the course, meaning I should finish in 12 weeks.

My new predictions are:

* Total hours per week: 4 - 6 hours
* Total weeks to complete the course: 14 - 18 weeks.


### 4 Week time breakdown (Rough)

* Deliberate Practice 3:00
* Quiz 2:10
* Video, Reading, Notes, Understanding etc: 14:10
* Mastery (Distributed Practice): 1:20
