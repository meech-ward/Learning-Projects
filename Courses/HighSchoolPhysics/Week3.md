# High School Physics

## Week 3

This is the first week that I actually hit my time goal of at least 5 hours. I managed about 6 and a half hours of Physics time.

* Centripetal force and gravitation deliberate practice 0:45
* Centripetal force and gravitation video & notes 2:30
* Forces Delibiratet Practice	 0:50
* Forces Quiz 0:40
* Forces Reading & Notes 0:50	
* Forces Video & Notes 0:20
* Mastery 0:30

I really liked this week, Forces and gravity are really interesting. It's amazing at how intuative some of these things become after a little bit of learning. 

I feel great about the progress I'm making but I am starting to worry that my original estimates of how much time I need to complete this course are wrong. I will try and make a better evaluation after the end of next week, but I think this course will take me longer than I originally planned.
