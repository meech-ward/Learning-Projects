# High School Physics

## Why *High School* Physics? 

Well I don't know much about physics and most resrouces for learning the subject are focused at high school studetns. Thus I will be attempting to learn physics at a high school level.

## Why?

As I just mentioned, I don't know much about physics or any science other than computer science. I want to know more about how everything works, not just computers. I'm going to learn basic Physics and Chemistry and evaluate from there.

## What?

* I am attempting to learn the equivalent of high school AP Physics. I will be using mostly [Khan Academy's Physics Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics) to learn the material.
* I would like to understand every topic taugh in this course, and know when to use the correct formulas. I don't feel the need to memorize any formulas though.
* Understand all the concepts taught in the Khan Physics videos
* As a bonus, I would also like to understand all the concepts taught in the [Crash Course Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM8ECpBuQYE) videos.
* I have understood all the topics when I score 100% on a [varsitytutors.com](https://www.varsitytutors.com/high_school_physics-practice-tests) physics test.

## How?

* Watch videos and take notes. 
* After each video, answer questions from an ap physics question book to feel more comfortable.
* Use [distributed practice](#distributed-practice).
* After i've completed a [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics) section, take a quiz using [varsitytutors.com](https://www.varsitytutors.com/high_school_physics-practice-tests).
* After each week, quiz myself using my own 'question book method' material.
* At the end of the course, take a final exam using [varsitytutors.com](https://www.varsitytutors.com/high_school_physics-practice-tests).

## Learning Resources

I will focus on using [Khan Academy's Physics Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics) and [Crash Course Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM8ECpBuQYE) videos to learn the material. I will find other resouces when I feel the need to, but I will start out with only these.

Khan Academy has about 15 hours of physics videos.
Crash Course has about 4 hours of physics videos.


## Practice Materials

In order to test myself and deliberatly practice the subject to get better, I will use the following resources:

* Khan academy occasionally has some practice questions, it's not much but it's better than nothing.
* I purchased [Sterling Test Prep AP Physics 1 Practice Questions](https://www.amazon.com/Sterling-Test-Physics-Practice-Questions/dp/1514215608/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=9D3G54T50ZJTKCQBDXY8) I will practice the questions from this book. 
* [varsitytutors.com](https://www.varsitytutors.com/ap_physics_1-help) has some good online quizes that I can use after each section, and exams I can use at the end of the course.
* Question book method: while I'm taking notes, I'll capture the 'big idea' and translate that idea into questions. I can then use those questions when I'm practicing the topic later.

## Time Investment and Deadlines

* Total hours per week: 5 - 7.5 hours
* Total weeks to complete the course: 6 - 10 weeks.

My current schedule allows me to invest about 3 hours a day for 2 or 3 days a week. I am a fan of the [Pomedoro Technique](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwimjoSqv8XRAhVL6GMKHaZAD5AQFggaMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPomodoro_Technique&usg=AFQjCNEcNK-woTV-MpzRR0ilVXA1DnbXxQ&bvm=bv.144224172,d.cGc) (Working for 25 minutes then taking a break for 5 minutes), so 3 hours actually means 2.5 hours. This leavs my time investment at 5 - 7.5 hours per week.

I plan to break up that time like this:

* Coverage - (Watching videos and learning the material): 2/5 of my time
* Practice - (Work on practice problems): 2/5 of my time
* Other - (Organizing notes, Re-reading notes, etc): 1/5 of my time

This translates to about 2 - 3 hours a week, spent watching videos and taking notes. If I only watched videos for this amount of time I would finish watching all the videos in about 6 - 10 weeks. I usually watch videos at 1.5x - 2x speed and I think there will be a couple of videos that I don't need to watch, therefore I think I will be able to complete the entire course in this time.

This will be re-evaluated as I learn how effective it is.

## Distributed Practice

The pupose of this is to continually practice previously covered sections.

Before I start a new topic, I will create a card for it in the [projects](https://github.com/meech-ward/Learning-Projects/projects/1) section of this repo. When I have learned that topic, I will move it into 'Learned Topics' swim lane. Before starting for the day, I can look at this swim lane and practice a question from the subject at the top. If I answer a question correctly, I move it to the bottom of the lane, If I answer incorrectly, I move it to the top of the lane. Every time I answer correctly I will also check off a checkmark on the card and once I’ve checked the card 5 times, I’ll move it into another swim lane ‘mastered’ where it will no longer be reviewed.
