# High School Physics

## Week 7

I spent about 7 and a half hours on physics this week. Which makes up for not doing much last week.

* Distributed practice 1:00
* Impacts and linear momentum video, notes, & practice 2:30
* Work and energy Quiz 1:00
* Work and energy video & notes 3:00

I feel more accomplished this week for sure. One thing that really made me happy was taking the Work and Energy quiz. It was a 40 question quiz, it took me about an hour to complete, and I got 100% of the questions correct. My goal is to understand everything and prove this by scoring 100% on quizes, but I wasn't sure if that would be possible. Actually doing this makes me feel really good. This course is going to take me much longer than I originally planned, probably 5 times as long as I put in my first plan, but I feel like I'm understanding everything I'm learning, I'm not just getting by with the bare minimum.

I have also started to think about creating a platform to host courses like this. This course is really working out well for me but I can't really share it with anyone because i'm using a github project. I feel like I could make something simple, where I could host all the information I have here, but allow other people to use it.
