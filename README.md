My name is Sam Meech-Ward and I am using this repo to organize and keep track of my learning projects. 

## Goal

My goal is to learn the following subjects:

- [High School Physics](https://github.com/meech-ward/Learning-Projects/HighSchoolPhysics/README.md) (In Progress)
- High School Chemistry
- Khan Academy Electrical Engineering

View any of the subject individually to learn more about what and how I'm doing this.
