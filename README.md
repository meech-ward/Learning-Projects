My name is Sam Meech-Ward and I am using this repo to organize and keep track of my learning projects. My learning projects are created based on what i've learned by taking [Scott H Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/)'s [Rapid Learner](https://www.scotthyoung.com/courses/rapid-learner-course/) course.

## Goal

My goal is to learn the following subjects:

- [High School Physics](https://github.com/meech-ward/Learning-Projects/wiki/High-School-Physics) (Started on 2017-02-06)
- High School Chemistry
- Khan Academy Electrical Engineering

View any of the subject individually to learn more about what and how I'm doing this.
